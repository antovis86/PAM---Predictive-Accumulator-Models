% The DDM configuration consists of the priors of parameters and initial values. All priors are
% Gaussian in the space where the quantity they refer to is estimated. They are specified by their
% sufficient statistics: mean and variance (NOT standard deviation).

% The default values for all parameters are pre-defined with the mean set to "0" and the standard deviation set to "4".

% It is possible to modify the specified values and assign custom values to each parameter.
% This config file does not take any input and returns the
% structure "c" as output. "c" contains all the necessary values to 
% define and build a Wiener Diffusion Model.
