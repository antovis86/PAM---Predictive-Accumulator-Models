% The LNR configuration consists of the priors of parameters and initial values. All priors are
% Gaussian in the space where the quantity they refer to is estimated. They are specified by their
% sufficient statistics: mean and variance (NOT standard deviation).

% The default values for all parameters, except non-decision time (T), 
% are pre-defined with the mean set to "0" and the standard deviation set to "6.25".

% The default values of the parameter "T" are set to "-Inf" for the mean
% and "0" for the standard deviation. With this combination of parameters
% the value of "T" is not estimated. It is possible to estimate "T"
% parameter by changing the values of the aforementioned parameters.

% It is possible to modify the specified values and assign custom values to each parameter.

% This config file does not take any input and returns the
% structure "c" as output. "c" contains all the necessary values to 
% define and build a Linear Deterministic Model.
